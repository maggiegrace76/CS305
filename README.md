For Artemis Financial, I improved their software security by finding and fixing weaknesses in their system. I added extra layers of protection like multi-factor authentication, data encryption, and a firewall to keep sensitive information safe. I also made sure everything worked correctly by testing and following secure coding practices. To document these changes, I created a security certificate that showed all the steps taken to make the system safer. This certificate helps Artemis Financial build trust with clients by showing they care about security. This experience strengthened my skills, which I can use in future projects.
